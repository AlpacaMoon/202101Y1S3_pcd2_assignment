### Assignment Tasks
Your team's task is to design and build a console-based system using C language. The requirement is to develop part of a simple TarucSejahtera contact-tracing system (for example for a pandemic disease like Covid-19) that can be used within a school or college. Basically it has to keep track of visitors (eg. student/ staff / other workers, etc)
who enter and exit any venue (eg. lecture hall, tutorial room, canteen etc). The system should contain a selection of modules from the following list:

- Visitor Information Module – to handle registration and maintenance of visitor information / profiles. Visitors may include students, faculty/ administrative/office staff, general workers, outsiders (suppliers, repairmen etc). 
- Venue Information Module – to maintain information about venues (room/building) in the college, including tutorial rooms, canteens, laboratories and others.
- Administrative Staff Module – to store information about administrative staff, ie. those who will log in and perform activities (eg. searching, reporting etc) on various
aspects of the system. 
- Visits and Exits Module - to record details of each visit by a visitor to a venue.
- Sanitization Records Module – to record details about sanitizing done on venues. Based on the given list, each member is required to choose and be in charge of one module. The number of modules in the system should be based on the number of members in your team. You may need to search for other relevant information in order to understand the functionalities of your module, and make reasonable assumptions.
